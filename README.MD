Reading the frequency of a vehicle remote requires specialized equipment like an RF (Radio Frequency) receiver module and may involve a bit of trial and error. Here's a basic outline of how you might approach it using an Arduino:

Get the Required Components:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
RF receiver module (e.g., 433MHz receiver module)
Jumper wires
Connect the RF Receiver Module:

Connect the RF receiver module to your Arduino. The receiver module typically has three pins: VCC, GND, and Data.

VCC -> 5V on Arduino
GND -> GND on Arduino
Data -> Any digital pin (e.g., D2)
Install the RF Receiver Library:

Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries....
Search for and install an RF receiver library (e.g., VirtualWire or RadioHead).


Use Guidelines and terms 

Interpret the Data:

This code sets up the RF receiver and listens for any incoming data. When data is received, it will be printed in hexadecimal format. You'll need to analyze this data to determine the frequency or protocol used by the vehicle remote.

Use a Spectrum Analyzer (Optional):

If you want to precisely measure the frequency, you might need a spectrum analyzer. This is a more advanced piece of equipment and typically not something you can directly interface with an Arduino.

Please note that reading the frequency of a vehicle remote may not give you much useful information on its own. Vehicle remotes often use complex encoding schemes and security measures to prevent unauthorized access. Decoding these signals requires specialized knowledge and equipment. It's important to respect privacy and legal restrictions when working with RF signals. Always ensure that you have the necessary permissions and are complying with local regulations.
